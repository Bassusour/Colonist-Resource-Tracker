# Colonist.io Resource Tracker

This is a chrome extension for the website https://colonist.io/, that keeps track of all the players resources. 
It works by reading the chat-log during the game, and updating players resources accordingly. Keep in mind that if you disconnect and reconnect during a game, all tracking will be lost. 

Please note that it is not perfect, since not all necessary data is available through the chat log, but 99% is. 

## Setup
1. Download this zip folder, and extract it. 
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Click 'Load unpacked' in top left corner
4. Select the extracted folder
5. Enjoy!
