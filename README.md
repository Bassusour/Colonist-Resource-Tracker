# Colonist.io Resource Tracker

This is a chrome extension for the website https://colonist.io/, that keeps track of all the players resources. 
It works by reading the game-log during the game, and updating players resources accordingly. 

Please note that it is not perfect, since not all necessary data is available through the chat log. The only exception is when the monopoly card is played, where image analysis may be required to correctly track all the resources.
